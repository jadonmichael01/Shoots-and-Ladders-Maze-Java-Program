# Shoots-and-Ladders-Maze-Java-Program
In this project, I implemented a Java program that finds the shortest path that a hare needs to take to go through 
a grid-shape maze. The hare enters the maze from a specific square (start) and leaves the maze at another specific 
square.
Implemented a txt file as a Maze map that contains multiple rows and columns. 
Implemented a recursive operation to solve the maze based on the maze's cells.
